### Hi there 👋🏻

I am Jannik, a machine learning engineer with a strong background in Python, hyperparameter optimisation and scientific computing.

I love to design and implement efficient algorithms especially in abstract domains.

My other interests include: AGI, computational geometry, knowledge representation and reasoning, machine and reinforment learning.

With my open source projects I want to give back to the community I owe so much to.
