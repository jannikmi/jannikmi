### Hi there

I am Jannik, a machine learning engineer with a strong background in Python, hyperparameter optimisation, scientific computing and computer engineering.

I love to design and implement efficient algorithms especially in abstract domains.

My other interests include: AGI, computational geometry, hyperparameter optimisation, knowledge representation and reasoning, machine and reinforment learning.

With my open source projects I want to give back to the community I owe so much to.
